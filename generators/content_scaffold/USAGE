Description:
    Scaffolds an entire component resource, from model to controller and
    views. The resource is ready to use as a starting point for your 
    RESTful, resource-oriented component.

    Pass the name of the model (in singular form), either CamelCased or
    under_scored, as the first argument, and an optional list of attribute
    pairs.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes.

    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the resource immediately.

    For example, 'component_scaffold header title:string body:text'
    gives you a model with those three attributes, a controller that handles
    the create/show/update/destroy, forms to create and edit your headers,
	and an index that lists them all, as well as a map.resources :headers
    declaration in config/routes.rb.

    If you want to remove all the generated files, run
    'script/destroy component_scaffold ModelName'.

Examples:
    `./script/generate component_scaffold post`
    `./script/generate component_scaffold post title:string body:text`
    `./script/generate component_scaffold purchase amount:decimal`
